I am a third-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professors Moritz Hardt and Jacob Steinhardt. Iâ€™m broadly interested in ensuring that machine learning has positive social impact, from developing theoretical foundations for algorithmic fairness to empirical investigations into robustness of ML systems.
