I am a Machine Learning Scientist on the Foundation Model (Large Language Modeling) team at Prescient Design, Genentech. My research focus is on foundation models for advancing science. I did my PhD in machine learning at UC Berkeley advised by [Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org/) and [Jacob Steinhardt](https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/), where I worked on algorithmic fairness, interpretability of deep networks, and training set compositions for foundation models in biology. 

During my PhD, in the summer and fall of 2022 I was AI resident at [Google X](https://x.company/) working on biological sequence design. Before my PhD, I was lucky to be advised by [Sebastian Tschiatschek](https://tschiatschek.net/) while at University of Cambridge and [Cynthia Dwork](https://dwork.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Jeffrey Macklis](https://macklislab.hscrb.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I am grateful for support from the [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/) during my MPhil and for support from the NSF GRFP and the [Open Philanthropy AI Fellows Program](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence-the-open-phil-ai-fellowship/) during my PhD.
