I am a third-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professors Moritz Hardt and Jacob Steinhardt. I have previously worked on the theoretical foundations for algorithmic fairness and empirical investigations into interpretability and robustness of ML systems. These days I am particularly interested in applications of machine learning to protein and molecule design.
